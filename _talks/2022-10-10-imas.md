**Abstract:**
*The Antarctic ice cover evolves rapidly over the winter season. Incoming waves from the Southern Ocean promote the formation of pancake ice whilst fracturing larger floes. Once these waves are sufficiently attenuated, ice floes are able to consolidate and transition into the inner pack. Along the Antarctic coastline, polynyas produce large amounts of new ice over the winter. The latest version of CICE includes a floe size distribution (FSD) which allows us to model the lateral size of floes. The “radius” of new ice floes in CICE is determined by the tensile stress the wave field enacts on ice. This results in floes with small radii (pancakes) to form when a significant amount of wave energy is present, with sheet ice forming in the absence of such a wave field. In this talk, I will present how we can use statistical classification on CICE6 outputs to recognise the varying types of ice cover to get a  broader insight of Antarctic sea ice.*
