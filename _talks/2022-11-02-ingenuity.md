**Abstract:**
*The outer band of sea ice (marginal ice zone) around Antarctica is bombarded with extreme polar cyclones and large swell waves (greater than 14 metres) from the Southern Ocean. During winter, waves promote the formation of small round chunks of sea ice (known as pancakes) whilst breaking up larger sea ice floes. Polar cyclones have been recently found to advect large amounts pancake ice hundreds of kilometres over only a couple of days. These dynamics lead to increased variability in measurements of total sea ice area. This project presents how we can simulate such events with a mathematical model to help understand Antarcticaâ€™s puzzling response to climate change.*
